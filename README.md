**Try — Practice & Experiments**
========================================

The `Try` folder holds assorted practice code and small experiments in multiple languages: C, JavaScript, Java, Node.js and Python. It is a sandbox for snippets, exercises and quick projects used during learning or testing ideas.

Repository Structure
=====================

```
Try/
 ┣ C language try/
 ┣ Html, css  try/
 ┣ java try/
 ┣ Javascript try/
 ┣ Node.js try/
 ┗ python try/
```

Highlights
----------
- **C language try:** Arrays, loops, structures, file I/O, small projects and practice problems.
- **Html, css try:** Short demos (marquee, tables, forms, transforms) for quick layout practice.
- **Javascript try:** Several standalone examples and tiny apps (calculators, OTP generator, assistant scripts).
- **Node.js try:** Example modules and small HTTP/URL experiments.
- **python try:** Small scripts including QR code and YouTube download helpers.

How to use
----------
- Open language-specific folders and run examples using the appropriate toolchain (e.g., GCC for C, Node for JS, Python interpreter for `.py` files).
- For Node projects with `package.json`, run these commands inside the project folder:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev # or `node <entry-file>` as appropriate
```

Detailed folder listing
-----------------------
```
Try/
 ┣ C language try/         # arrays, structs, file I/O, small projects
 ┣ Html, css  try/         # short layout demos (marquee, tables, forms)
 ┣ java try/               # small Java examples
 ┣ Javascript try/         # utilities, assistant scripts, small apps
 ┣ Node.js try/            # example modules, http and fs experiments
 ┗ python try/             # scripts (QR code demo, YouTube downloader)
```

If you want
-----------
- I can add per-subfolder `README.md` files with one-line descriptions and run instructions.
- I can also standardize Node examples to use consistent `package.json` scripts.

Notes
-----
- These are experimental and learning snippets — expect varied formatting and styles.
- I can help standardize one of these folders (e.g., add a `Makefile`, `README` per subfolder, or convert Node examples to modules) if you want.
